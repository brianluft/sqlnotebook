# SQL Notebook

SQL Notebook is a free Windows app for exploring and manipulating tabular data.
It is powered by a supercharged [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) engine, supporting both [standard SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92) queries and SQL Notebook-specific commands.
Everything you need to answer analysis questions about your data, regardless of its format or origin, is built into SQL Notebook.
