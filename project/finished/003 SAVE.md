- [x] Add language statement for saving the notebook.
    - [x] Syntax: 'SAVE' [<filename>]
    - [x] Filename is IdentifierOrExpr. If not provided, it saves to the existing filename. If the notebook is unsaved and no filename is provided, then an exception is thrown: "SAVE: No filename was specified and the notebook is untitled."
    - [x] Any other exception thrown in the process of saving is rethrown with "SAVE: " prepended to the error message.
    - [x] Update the doc for SqlNotebookCmd to mention that the user can use `SAVE` to save their changes, since the CLI does not save by default.
    - [x] Write your tests as regular C# rather than as a .sql script because our .sql test harness isn't sophisticated enough to test this. You need to verify that the save actually works by re-opening the notebook and seeing if the changes are there.
    - Bugs
        - [x] Add a documentation caveat. `SAVE` only works _outside_ of a transaction. If the user has a transaction active, `SAVE` will fail (it already does). Because the UI defaults script execution to "Implicit BEGIN ... COMMIT", this means `SAVE` will simply produce an error when the user first attempts to try it. Explain that "None (auto-commit)" transaction mode must be used when running the `SAVE` command in the UI. This is not an issue with the CLI tool `SqlNotebookCmd` because it doesn't use an implicit BEGIN ... COMMIT.
