- [ ] Add language statement for saving the notebook.
    - [ ] Syntax: 'SAVE' [<filename>]
    - [ ] Filename is IdentifierOrExpr. If not provided, it saves to the existing filename. If the notebook is unsaved and no filename is provided, then an exception is thrown: "SAVE: No filename was specified and the notebook is untitled."
    - [ ] Any other exception thrown in the process of saving is rethrown with "SAVE: " prepended to the error message.
    - [ ] Update the doc for SqlNotebookCmd to mention that the user can use `SAVE` to save their changes, since the CLI does not save by default.
    - [ ] Write your tests as regular C# rather than as a .sql script because our .sql test harness isn't sophisticated enough to test this. You need to verify that the save actually works by re-opening the notebook and seeing if the changes are there.
- [ ] Add language statement for deleting scripts and pages.
    - [ ] Syntax: 'DROP' 'SCRIPT' <name>
    - [ ] Syntax: 'DROP' 'PAGE' <name>
    - [ ] <name> is IdentifierOrExpr.
    - [ ] Consider: `DROP` is already a SQL command. We have to peek the token afterwards to see if it's SCRIPT or PAGE, otherwise fall back to parsing it (starting at `DROP` token) as an `SqlStmt`. See how we did `BEGIN TRY` as an example.
    - [ ] If the user has the script or page open in the UI, and the script deletes it, then the editor must close. We already do this when the user deletes a script or page in the "Table of Contents" pane in the UI. However, this is trickier when _inside_ a script execution. Ensure you address reentrancy and layering issues.
    - [ ] If the script or page doesn't exist, an exception is thrown.
    - [ ] Write your tests as regular C#, again our .sql harness isn't sophisticated enough. Test that the script or page actually gets deleted.
- [ ] Add language statement for adding scripts.
    - [ ] Syntax: 'CREATE' 'SCRIPT' <name> 'AS' <sql commands>
    - [ ] <name> and <sql commands> are IdentifierOrExpr.
    - [ ] Consider: 'CREATE' is already a SQL command. See `BEGIN TRY` as an example of what to do.
    - [ ] If the name already exists (case insensitive) then an exception is thrown.
    - [ ] Our .sql harness should do it, you should be able to `CREATE SCRIPT` and then `EXECUTE`.
