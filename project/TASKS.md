- [ ] Add code signing to our GitHub Actions release process
    - [ ] It used to be integrated into New-Release.ps1, which ran in GitHub Actions, but now code signing requires a physical HSM that we can't use in the cloud. We will split New-Release.ps1 into two phases: 1.) Everything leading up to "Generate portable ZIP", and 2.) Generating the portable zip, and the MSI with WiX. This will allow us to run phase 1 in GitHub Actions, then I will download the resulting release files, sign the EXE myself, and then run phase 2 locally.
    - [x] Add a mandatory parameter to New-Release.ps1 for `-Phase 1` or `-Phase 2`.
    - [x] Update `.github\workflows\sqlnotebook.yml` to run phase 1 only, then to upload an artifact containing `src/SqlNotebook/bin/*`, this will contain the release files needed for the portable zip and WiX.
    - [x] Update `scripts/publish.sh` to run phase 1 only; we use this for local development and testing of the phase 1 process.
    - [x] Update the release instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Remember that phase 1 runs in GitHub Actions and phase 2 runs locally where the HSM is located.
    - [ ] Here are the instructions for signing locally, please format it nicely:
        - Install Windows SDK in order to get signtool. The only necessary features are "Windows SDK Signing Tools for Desktop Apps" and "MSI Tools". https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/
        - Search for signtool in C:\Program Files (x86). Set $signtool to its path.
        - Find the HSM entry in 1Password. Set $sha1 to the SHA1 hash. Keep the entry up so you can copy the password out.
        - Download the phase 1 zip from GitHub Actions.
        - Set $sha1 to the hash of the code signing certificate, then: `& $signtool sign /v /tr http://timestamp.sectigo.com /fd SHA256 /td SHA256 /sha1 $sha1 SqlNotebook.exe`. Paste the password when prompted.
        - Verify digital signature in the file properties.
        - Run `New-Release.ps1` phase 2.
    - [ ] You can test phase 1 yourself via `publish.sh`. You cannot test phase 2 or the GitHub Actions workflow; I will have to test those.
