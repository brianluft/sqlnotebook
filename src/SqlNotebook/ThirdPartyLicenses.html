  "https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a><br>
  <br>
  All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors,
  and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the
  public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone
  is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code
  form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.<br>
  <br>
  The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite
  library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process
  (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from
  these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with
  those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.<br>
  <br>
  All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or
  from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have
  public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from
  other projects.<br>

  As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with

  Exception</a><br>
  Updated February 23, 2012<br>
  <br>
  What is the FOSS License Exception?<br>
  <p>Oracle’s Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS") License Exception (formerly known as the FLOSS License Exception)
  allows developers of FOSS applications to include Oracle's MySQL Client Libraries (also referred to as "MySQL
  Drivers" or "MySQL Connectors") with their FOSS applications. MySQL Client Libraries are typically licensed pursuant
  to version 2 of the General Public License (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target=
  "_blank">"GPL"</a>), but this exception permits distribution of certain MySQL Client Libraries with a developer’s
  FOSS applications licensed under the terms of another FOSS license listed below, even though such other FOSS license
  may be incompatible with the GPL.</p>
  <p>The following terms and conditions describe the circumstances under which Oracle’s FOSS License Exception
  applies.</p>Oracle’s FOSS License Exception Terms and Conditions<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Definitions.<br>
    <br>
    "Derivative Work" means a derivative work, as defined under applicable copyright law, formed entirely from the
    Program and one or more FOSS Applications.<br>
    <br>
    "FOSS Application" means a free and open source software application distributed subject to a license listed in the
    section below titled "FOSS License List."<br>
    <br>
    "FOSS Notice" means a notice placed by Oracle or MySQL in a copy of the MySQL Client Libraries stating that such
    copy of the MySQL Client Libraries may be distributed under Oracle's or MySQL’s FOSS (or FLOSS) License
    Exception.<br>
    <br>
    "Independent Work" means portions of the Derivative Work that are not derived from the Program and can reasonably
    be considered independent and separate works.<br>
    <br>
    "Program" means a copy of Oracle’s MySQL Client Libraries that contains a FOSS Notice.<br></li>
    <li>A FOSS application developer ("you" or "your") may distribute a Derivative Work provided that you and the
    Derivative Work meet all of the following conditions:<br>
      <br>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and all portions (including modifications) of the Program
        included in the Derivative Work (provided that this condition does not apply to Independent Works);</li>
        <li>The Derivative Work does not include any work licensed under the GPL other than the Program;</li>
        <li>You distribute Independent Works subject to a license listed in the section below titled "FOSS License
        List";</li>
        <li>You distribute Independent Works in object code or executable form with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code on the same medium and under the same FOSS license applying to the object code or
        executable forms;</li>
        <li>All works that are aggregated with the Program or the Derivative Work on a medium or volume of storage are
        not derivative works of the Program, Derivative Work or FOSS Application, and must reasonably be considered
        independent and separate works.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Oracle reserves all rights not expressly granted in these terms and conditions. If all of the above conditions
    are not met, then this FOSS License Exception does not apply to you or your Derivative Work.</li>

  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  <br>
  Version 2, June 1991<br>
  <br>
  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
  <br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
  Preamble<br>
  <br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
  General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
  software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's
  software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
  covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
  <br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to
  make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
  new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
  <br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
  surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of
  the software, or if you modify it.<br>
  <br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
  all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
  show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
  <br>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you
  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
  <br>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no
  warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
  know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the
  original authors' reputations.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
  redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at
  all.<br>
  <br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br>
  <br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
  <br>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
  may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program
  or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that
  is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
  licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
  <br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its
  scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
  contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether
  that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
  provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
  of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
  other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
  <br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
  protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
  <br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
  and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
  all of these conditions:<br>
  <br>
  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
  any change.<br>
  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
  Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
  License.<br>
  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running
  for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
  copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users
  may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
  the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
  the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
  its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the
  same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the
  terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
  part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
  <br>
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
  rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
  the Program.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
  Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
  License.<br>
  <br>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
  <br>
  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
  terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
  than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
  source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
  interchange; or,<br>
  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
  alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or
  executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable
  work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
  source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
  executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br>
  <br>
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
  offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
  even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
  <br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.
  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
  your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
  <br>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
  permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do
  not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
  indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
  modifying the Program or works based on it.<br>
  <br>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
  license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
  responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<br>
  <br>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited
  to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
  conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so
  as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
  consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
  redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way
  you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
  <br>
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the
  section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
  <br>
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
  contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
  software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
  contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
  that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
  system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
  <br>
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
  License.<br>
  <br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
  copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
  geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
  License.<br>
  <br>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to
  time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
  problems or concerns.<br>
  <br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License
  which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
  number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are
  different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
  Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
  by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
  and reuse of software generally.<br>
  <br>
  NO WARRANTY<br>
  <br>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
  PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
  OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
  <br>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER
  PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
  (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
  <br>
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

  MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS<br>
  MICROSOFT WINDOWS API CODE PACK FOR MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK<br>
  ___________________________________________________<br>
  These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its
  affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you
  received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft<br>
  • updates,<br>
  • supplements,<br>
  • Internet-based services, and<br>
  • support services<br>
  for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.<br>
  _______________________________________________________________________________________<br>
  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.<br>
  If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.<br>
  1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.<br>
  • You may use any number of copies of the software to design, develop and test your programs that run on a Microsoft
  Windows operating system.<br>
  • This agreement gives you rights to the software only. Any rights to a Microsoft Windows operating system (such as
  testing pre-release versions of Windows in a live operating environment) are provided separately by the license terms
  for Windows.<br>
  2. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.<br>
  a. Distributable Code. You may modify, copy, and distribute the software, in source or compiled form, to run on a
  Microsoft Windows operating system.<br>
  ii. Distribution Requirements. If you distribute the software, you must<br>
  • require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this
  agreement;<br>
  • if you modify the software and distribute such modified files, include prominent notices in such modified files so
  that recipients know that they are not receiving the original software;<br>
  • display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and<br>
  • indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the
  distribution or use of your programs or to your modifications to the software.<br>
  iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not<br>
  • alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the software;<br>
  • use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are
  endorsed by Microsoft;<br>
  • include the software in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or<br>
  • modify or distribute the source code of the software so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License.
  An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that<br>
  • the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or<br>
  • others have the right to modify it.<br>
  3. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the
  software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
  you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.<br>
  4. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with
  all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include
  restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see
  &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/exporting&gt;.<br>
  5. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.<br>
  6. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support
  services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.<br>
  7. APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
  a. United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation
  of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the
  state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair
  competition laws, and in tort.<br>
  b. Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.<br>
  8. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your
  country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does
  not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.<br>
  9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO
  EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH
  THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.<br>
  10. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT
  DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
  INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.<br>
  This limitation applies to<br>
  • anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
  programs; and<br>
  • claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other
  tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.<br>
  It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above
  limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
  incidental, consequential or other damages.<br>
  Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided
  below in French.<br>
  Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies
  ci-dessous en français.<br>
  EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel
  est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de
  droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La
  ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage
  particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.<br>
  LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft
  et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez
  prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires
  et pertes de bénéfices.<br>
  Cette limitation concerne :<br>
  • tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet
  tiers ou dans des programmes tiers ; et<br>
  • les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de
  négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.<br>
  Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si
  votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou
  de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre
  égard.<br>
  EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par
  les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si
  celles-ci ne le permettent pas.<br>

For the purposes<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br><br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>      the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br><br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>      meet the following conditions:<br><br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br><br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>          stating that You changed the files; and<br><br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>          the Derivative Works; and<br><br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>          as modifying the License.<br><br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>      the conditions stated in this License.<br><br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br><br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br><br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br><br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>      replaced with your own identifying information.
