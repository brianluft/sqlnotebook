Carefully follow this process step by step.

1. Run the build and tests with `scripts/build.sh`.
2. Choose the tasks you intend to perform.
    - If the user's prompt includes a task assignment, then do that.
    - If there are any errors or code coverage holes, then your assigned task is to fix that.
    - If the build succeeded, read the file [TASKS.md](mdc:project/TASKS.md). Your assignment is the next unchecked task. You may do multiple consecutive related tasks at once if it makes sense. Choose the tasks you intend to perform ahead of time and stick to those tasks ONLY.
3. Perform the chosen tasks to completion.
4. Run `scripts/build.sh` again to confirm.
5. Re-read `.cursor/rules/do-tasks.mdc` (this file) so you don't forget to finish these steps.
6. If everything is good, format the code with `scripts/format.sh`.
7. Update TASKS.md to check off the tasks you completed.
8. Commit to git with a short one-line commit message.
9. STOP. You must give me an opportunity to review. Do not start more tasks.

The tasks are expected to be doable. If you run into serious problems, STOP and ask for help.
