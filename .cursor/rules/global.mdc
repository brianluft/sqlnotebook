# SQL Notebook
C#, .NET 7.0, Windows Forms
"Open source app for casual data exploration in SQL. Import your data from CSV, Excel, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Then use a Jupyter-style notebook interface for exploratory queries, and write stored procedures for reusable logic. SQL Notebook is powered by an extended SQLite engine, supporting both standard SQL queries and SQL Notebook-specific commands and functions."

# Rules
- ALWAYS build after making code changes, using `scripts/build.sh`

# Suggestions
- Use `sed -n '8,8p' filename` to find the code at or around a particular line number
